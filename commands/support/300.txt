In 5 minutes I can fully cook Instant Cup Noodles :ramen: and eat half of it, yet your server can't start in that time?  
You for sure:
a) Have way too many resources. You know all those oversized asset warnings? yeah that's a thing.
b) Have some slow-loading resources like chocohax.
c) Have a slow CPU.
Do not try to change txAdmin, fix YOUR server.
